List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.
mdate	team1	score1	team2	score2

Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.

SELECT
    mdate,
    team1,
    SUM( CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS score1,
    team2,
    SUM( CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS score2
FROM game LEFT JOIN goal
    ON id = matchid
GROUP BY mdate, team1, team2
ORDER BY mdate, team1, team2
